Calculating an expression using Stack and Prefix Representation

Prefix representation is just another way to write an expression
for example 
1 + 2 --> + 1 2
1 + 2 + 3 * 4 + 6 --> + 1 + 2 + * 3 4 6 
in this program I will convert given normal expression to its prefix representation
and calculate it

In this version only digits, + * operators allowed.
